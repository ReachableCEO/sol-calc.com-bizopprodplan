## Sol-Calc.com Executive Summary

A solar calculator being built by the @ReachableCEO for his custom design / ground mount of 5kw of panels for TSYS HQ.

Very early microservice development underway.

  - For sol-calc, the core micro service is GPLv3. You would have complete control over the branding / pricing etc of the SAAS front end (which is how most people would use it. So few would self host and they wouldnâ€™t have paid anyway). This allows for the community to provide feedback on the algorithm. Could someone take it and launch a competing service ? Sure. Will they? Doubtful. Branding is a thing.
